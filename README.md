Practical 2
AIM: Create Android Application to demonstrate functions of Activity Life Cycle and Basic UI.


Description:
This Android application demonstrates the Activity Life Cycle along with a simple Basic UI. The UI contains a TextView displaying "Hello World" in the center of the screen with a white background, Black text color, 27sp font size, and bold + italic style.
The app logs each lifecycle method (onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onRestart, onDestroy) in Logcat, and also shows the method name using Toast and Snackbar messages whenever a lifecycle event occurs.

Logcat Output:
<img width="1332" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1dc89aa-7282-4309-bfb4-598cba6e9587" />

Toast & Snackbar :
